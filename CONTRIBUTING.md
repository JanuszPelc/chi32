# Contributing to CHI32

This project is a passion project maintained by a single developer with limited time for general maintenance tasks.

However, language ports that adhere to the comprehensive [Porting Guide](./docs/chi32_porting_guide.md) are a top priority and will receive prompt and focused support. Contributors of accepted ports will also be treated as Code Owners for their respective implementations, helping to decentralize long-term maintenance.

For other types of contributions (e.g. feature suggestions, refactors, general issues), please understand that review and response times may vary. If you're considering a change, please open an issue first to discuss it before submitting a pull request.

All contributions must be licensed under the MIT License. By submitting, you affirm that you have the rights to contribute and agree to license your work accordingly. Please ensure all project-related communication is respectful and constructive.
